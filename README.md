## About

**Mailbox Interface** is a key feature within the dashboard, designed to streamline internal communication. It allows users to receive emails directly in their inbox, compose and send messages to colleagues, view email content, delete messages, and mark emails as read. This feature integrates seamlessly with the dashboard, providing an intuitive and efficient way for users to manage their communications within the organization.

## Features

* **Login**: A secure login page with a simple form for email and password. When the entered credentials match the mock data, the user is redirected to the Dashboard, where their inbox emails are displayed. All internal routes are protected and accessible only to authenticated users with valid credentials.

* **Mailbox**
The mailbox interface allows users to view their inbox and sent emails. Users can delete emails, mark unread emails as read, and interact with messages directly. The UI is built to support future extensions, including highlighting emails, sorting them into important folders, managing drafts, and adding categories or labels.

* **Compose Email**
Users can create and send new emails through the Compose feature. It can be accessed from the Compose Email button in the mailbox main page, which opens a modal for quick email drafting, or from the navigation menu under the mailbox feature, which provides a full dedicated page. Both options allow users to enter recipient details, subject, and message content before sending.

* **View Email**
Users can open and read individual emails in detail. The View Email page displays the email subject, sender and recipient information, and the full body of the message. From this view, users can also delete the email or mark it as read, ensuring better inbox management.

* **Email Management Actions**
The mailbox includes essential tools for managing emails efficiently. Users can delete emails, mark unread emails as read.

## üé® Dynamic Icon Library

One of the most interesting and reusable features of this project is the **custom icon library** I built. It serves as a **single source of truth for all SVG icons** in the application, allowing consistent and dynamic usage throughout the dashboard. This library lets you **add, generate, and use icons freely** in a streamlined and scalable way.

### How It Works

1. **Add an Icon**  
   - Place the SVG path of the new icon in `icons/icons.ts` as a new object in the `icons` array.  
   - Make sure to include the **name** and **viewBox** of the icon.

2. **Generate or Watch Icons**  
   - Run the generator after every update:  
     ```bash
     npm run generate-icons
     ```  
   - Or keep the watcher running during development for automatic updates:  
     ```bash
     npm run watch-icons
     ```  

3. **Use Icons Across the App**  
   - Icons can be called as components dynamically anywhere in the application.  
   - Component names follow the pattern: `iconName + Icon` (e.g., `DashboardIcon`).

This approach ensures **consistency, scalability, and reusability** for all icon needs in the project, making the UI cohesive and easy to maintain.
